	<p>Born in Lincoln, Illinois, relocated to Chickamauga, Georgia in 2005 and loving every minute of it! For the past several years I have worked as a Family Engagement Coordinator for a local elementary school in NW Georgia. My school families and students bring me so much joy! When my husband and I began the search for our first home, we called Martha Alexander to help us on our journey. She was then and still is fantastic to work with! It was very obvious to see how much she loved her job and I realized then that this was something I wanted to be a part of. I took the leap into real estate and I’m loving being a part of Elite Realtors! Whether it be navigating the way for first time home buyers or helping you find your forever home, from the first phone call to closing, I will be there for my clients every step of the way.
