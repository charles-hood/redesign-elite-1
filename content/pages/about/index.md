    <p>My name is Arica Patterson. I am a devoted Christian, wife, and mother of three. I have been involved in real estate in some capacity my whole life. Most of my family is involved in real estate which has been instrumental in my success as a real estate agent. I am a firm believer in learning from the more experienced people around me. As I have watched and learned over the years I have been fortunate enough to be involved in every step of building a home as well as the remodeling process. As a result, when choosing a home or preparing a home for the market, I can offer my client the knowledge I have gained through my experiences. Buying or selling a home whether it is for you personally or as an investment is one of the biggest and most important decisions one will make. For this reason, I give each real estate transaction my full attention and do my very best to make the process a smooth and seamless transaction for all involved. I look forward to helping any real estate dreams become reality.</p>
